# Medical-Image-Analysis-using-Multimodal-LLM


## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a sophisticated medical image analysis system. The primary objective is to upload brain images and generate accurate descriptions of these images on the front end.
## Workflow
- **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of brain images to train and test the models.
- **Preprocessing**: Implementing preprocessing steps to prepare the images for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Training models using advanced Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to accurately describe the brain images.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the system to provide real-time analysis and descriptions of uploaded images.
## Current Progress
- **Model Used**: Initially used IDEFICS2, but results were not optimal.But, LLaVA and LLaVA-Med gave a optimal results.
- **Challenges Faced**: Encountered issues with training time, downloading models, and preprocessing images effectively. I faced resource problem with the available resource, had to use runpod for extra GPUs.
- **Underdevelopment**: I have been testing on speech input and output. Will be live soon.
## Future Plans
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Will be integrating audio input as well. So, user's will have an option to either type text or through speech. And output will also be eiter text or audio.
- **New Data**: Training on other body parts like "spinal cord" etc. 
## Conclusion
This project aims to leverage cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to provide accurate and efficient medical image analysis. By continually improving the models and workflow, we strive to enhance diagnostic capabilities and support medical professionals in their work.
